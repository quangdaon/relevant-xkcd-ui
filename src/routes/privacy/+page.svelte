		<h2>User Input & AI Processing</h2>
		<p>
			When you enter a search query, it is sent to OpenAI's API to generate a vector embedding that
			helps match your input to relevant xkcd comics. These queries are not stored by this app or
			used to identify you. However, OpenAI may log and retain API usage data per their own <a
				href="https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy">privacy policy</a
			>.
		</p>

		<h2>Cookies</h2>
		<p>
			This site does not use cookies. If it did, they'd be HTTP-only, Secure, and probably stale
			anyway.
